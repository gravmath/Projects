Then come out here for a day \\
And by the way, the name is Marcus \\
But if you like, you can call me Sensei \\
Well the emperor is in the pig sty \\
And the geisha is in the shack \\
And you better believe I'll hold them there \\
Till the feds, they pay me back \\

Kamikaze backbone \\
Nine iron spitfire \\
Continental samurai \\
Oh my lord \\
Brown sugar, sweet potato \\
Sourmash, baby back \\

I'll kiss your little boo boo \\
Make it better than it's ever felt before \\

Perhaps it's just the way the light falls \\
But everything looks like a target to me \\
And I don't know where the gun is \\
But I'm certain that it's pointed at me \\
