\title{On the Orthogonal Rotation of Coordinates}
\maketitle


This short note deals with determining the simple relation between a coordinate frame
described by the coordinates $(x,y)$ and one described by the coordinates $(x',y')$,
where the two frames are related by a simple rotation.

Assuming that the coordinates of the point \mP in terms of the $(x,y)$ system are known
then the coordinates of \mP in terms of the $(x',y')$ are determined as follows.

Referring to Figure \refp{fig:rot_coords}, the following two geometric relations are obvious:
\beas
  x' & = & \ell + m \\
  y  & = & a + b \eqp
\eeas
In addition, the following four trigonometric relations are obvious:
\beas
  x  & = & \ell \cos(\gq) \\
  a  & = & \ell \sin(\gq) \\
  y' & = & b \cos(\gq)    \\
  m  & = & m \cos(\gq) \eqp
\eeas

The coordinate $x'$ is related to $x$ and $y$ as follows:
\beas
  x' & = & \ell + m                                  \\
     & = & \ell + b \sin(\gq)                        \\
     & = & \ell \surp{y - a} \sin(\gq)               \\
     & = & \surp{\ell - a \sin(\gq)} + y \sin(\gq)   \\
     & = & \ell \surp{1 - \sin^2(\gq)} + y \sin(\gq) \\
     & = & \ell \cos^2 (\gq) + y \sin(\gq)           \\
     & = & x \cos(\gq) + y \sin(\gq) \eqp
\eeas
Likewise the $y'$ is related to $x$ and $y$ as follows:
\beas
  y' & = & b \cos(\gq)                            \\
     & = & \surp{y - a} \cos(\gq)                 \\
     & = & y \cos(\gq) - \ell \sin(\gq) \cos(\gq) \\
     & = & -x \sin(\gq) + y \cos(\gq) \eqp
\eeas


Generally, these relationships are written in matrix form as:
\bes
  \surp{\begin{array}{c} x' \\ y' \end{array}}
=
  \surp{
    \begin{array}{cc} \cos(\gq) & \sin(\gq) \\ -\cos(\gq) & \sin(\gq) \end{array}
    }
  \surp{\begin{array}{c} x \\ y \end{array}} \eqp
\ees
