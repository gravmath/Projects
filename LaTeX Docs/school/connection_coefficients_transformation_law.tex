\title{On the Transformation Properties of Connection Coefficients}
\maketitle

The transformation of the connection coefficients \Cnx{\gm}{\ga\gb} \back is desired.
To derive the relevant equations consider first the definition of the connection
coefficients
\bes
d \bV{e}{\gm} = \Cnx{\gs}{\gm\gn} \bV{e}{\ga} \bF{\gw}{\gn} \eqp
\ees
This equation must hold in all coordinate systems.
By writing the relation in the `barred' coordinate frame
and then expressing all of the objects in terms of the `un-barred' frame
the desired relation is obtained.
Thus start with the relation
\bes
d \bV{e}{\gba}  = \Cnx{\gbgm}{\gba\gbb} \bV{e}{\gbgm} \bF{\gw}{\gbb} \eqp
\ees
Now consider the exterior derivative of the transformation equation
\beas
d \bV{e}{\gba} & = & d \surp{ \Jac{\gm}{\gba} \bV{e}{\gm}} \\
               & = & \pdxby{\Jac{\gm}{\gba}}{x^{\gbb}} \bV{e}{\gm} \bF{\gw}{\gbb} +
                     \Jac{\gm}{\gba} d \bV{e}{\gm} \\
               & = & \pdxby{\Jac{\gm}{\gba}}{x^{\gbb}} \bV{e}{\gm} \bF{\gw}{\gbb} +
                     \Jac{\gm}{\gba} \Cnx{\gs}{\gm\gn} \bV{e}{\gs} \bF{\gw}{\gn} \eqp
\eeas
Equating the two expressions leads to
\bes
  \Cnx{\gbgm}{\gba\gbb} \bV{e}{\gbgm} \bF{\gw}{\gbb} =
  \pdxby{\Jac{\gm}{\gba}}{x^{\gbb}} \bV{e}{\gm} \bF{\gw}{\gbb} +
                     \Jac{\gm}{\gba} \Cnx{\gs}{\gm\gn} \bV{e}{\gs} \bF{\gw}{\gn} \eqp
\ees
Contracting the above expression with \bF{\gw}{\gbr} \back $\!$ and \bV{e}{\gbt} \back and using the
standard relation \sura{ \bF{\gw}{\gba},\bV{e}{\gbb} } = \idx{\gd}{\up{\gba}\dn{\gbb}}
results in
\bes
\Cnx{\gbr}{\gba\gbt} = \Jac{\gm}{\gba} \Jac{\gn}{\gbt} \Jac{\gbr}{\gs} \Cnx{\gs}{\gm\gn}
                         + \pdxby{\Jac{\gn}{\gba}}{x^{\gbt}} \Jac{\gbr}{\gn} \eqc
\ees
which compares exactly with equation 10.26, page 262 of MTW.
