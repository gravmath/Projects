Is this how the commands should work when citing
\idx{Q}{\up{ab}\dn{cd}} as a tensor in a sentence?  How about the
rather the use ${Q}^{ab}_{cd}$ as the fundamental thing? Okay, how
about something funky like \ipp{\op{A}}{\op{B}} or
\ipp{\cv{A}}{\cv{B}} or \ipp{\cuv{A}}{\cuv{B}}, what say? The
pesky issue associated with the definition of the Jacobian by
something like \idx{\Lambda}{\up{\gha}\dn{\ga}} is hopefully no
finished.
\be
A = \idx{\Lambda}{\up{\gha}\dn{\ga}}
