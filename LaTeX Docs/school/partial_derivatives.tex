\title{On the Transformation of Partial Derivatives}
\maketitle


This short note deals with determining the conversion of partial
derivatives from one coordinate system to another.  The case chosen will be one in
which orthogonal coordinates give way to oblique coordinates.
The geometry is shown in Figure \refp{fig:partial_derives}.

\begin{figure}

   \caption{Diagram for relating changes in partial derivatives under a
   change in coordinates.}\label{fig:partial_derives}
\end{figure}

The $r$ and $t$ coordinates are replaced by the $r$ and $m$ coordinates.
The transformation equations are given by
\bea
  r & = & r \\
  m & = & r + t \eqp
\eea
In order to transform the partial derivatives, the inverse transformation
is needed.  It is given by
\bea
  r & = & r \\
  t & = & r - m \eqp
\eea

The Jacobean is given by
\be
  \surp{
    \begin{array}{cc}
      \pdxby{r}{m} & \pdxby{t}{m} \\
                   &              \\
      \pdxby{r}{r} & \pdxby{t}{r}
    \end{array}
    }
  =
  \surp{
    \begin{array}{cc}
      0 & 1 \\
        &   \\
      1 & -1
    \end{array}
    } \eqp
\ee
The transformation of the partials is
\be
  \surp{
    \begin{array}{c}
      \pdby{m} \\
               \\
      \pdby{r}
    \end{array}
    }
  =
  \surp{
    \begin{array}{cc}
      0 & 1 \\
        &   \\
      1 & -1
    \end{array}
    }
  \surp{
    \begin{array}{c}
      \pdby{r} \\
               \\
      \pdby{t}
    \end{array}
    } \eqp
\ee
As an example consider the function
\be
f = \frac{\sin(r+t)}{r} = \frac{\sin(m)}{r} \eqp
\ee
The possible partial derivatives are
\bea
\left. \pdxby{f}{m} \right)_r & = & \frac{\cos(m)}{r}    \\
\left. \pdxby{f}{r} \right)_m & = & \frac{-\sin(m)}{r^2} \\
\left. \pdxby{f}{t} \right)_r & = & \frac{\cos(r+t)}{r}  \\
\left. \pdxby{f}{r} \right)_t & = & \frac{-\sin(r+t)}{r^2} + \frac{\cos(r+t)}{r} \eqp
\eea

Now from the above equations it is obvious that
\be
  \left. \pdxby{f}{r} \right)_m = \left. \pdxby{f}{r} \right)_t - \left. \pdxby{f}{t} \right)_r
\ee
which is the same result obtained using the Jacobian.  This geometric relation is shown in
the Figure by the red vectors.
