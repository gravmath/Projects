\title{On the Riemann Tensor}
\maketitle


The purpose of this short note is to demonstrate that the Riemann tensor is
in fact a tensor (i.e. a linear machine).  The starting point will be
the general formula for the curvature operator given by
\bes
  \mR\surp{\cs{B},\cs{C}} = \surb{\nabla_{\cs{B}},\nabla_{\cs{C}}}
      - \nabla_{\surb{\cs{B},\cs{C}}} \eqp
\ees
In the process, the formulas for the Riemann tensor in both a coordinate and non-
coordinate basis will be found.  The notational style is a unique blend of
the abstract and index approaches.

\section{Coordinate Basis}

Start by examining the action of the curvature operator on a vector \cs{A}.
To set the notation, the term $\nabla_{\cs{C}} \cs{A}$ will be examined first.
\bea
  \nabla_{\cs{C}} \cs{A} & = & \sura{ d \surp{A^a \bv{a}},C^b \bv{b} }\nonumber \\
                         & = & \sura{\idx{A}{\up{a}\dn{,m}} \bv{a} \bd{m}
                                     + A^a \Cnx{n}{am} \bv{n} \bd{m},C^b \bv{b}} \nonumber \\
                         & = & \idx{A}{\up{a}\dn{,m}} \bv{a} C^b \ipb{\bd{m}}{\bv{b}}
                                     + A^a \Cnx{n}{am}\bv{n} C^b \ipb{\bd{m}}{\bv{b}} \nonumber \\
                         & = & \idx{A}{\up{a}\dn{,b}} \bv{a} C^b
                                     + A^a \Cnx{n}{ab} \bv{n} C^b \eqp
\eea
For simplicity in the next steps, the three pieces of the curvature operator will be
examined separately.
The first term yields
\bea
  \nabla_{\cs{B}} \nabla_{\cs{C}} \cs{A} & = & \surb{ \surp{\idx{A}{\up{a}\dn{;b}} C^{b}}_{,d}
                                             B^d + \idx{A}{\up{m}\dn{;b}} C^b \Cnx{a}{md} B^d }
                                             \bv{a} \eqp
\eea
The next term yields
\bea
  \nabla_{\cs{C}} \nabla_{\cs{B}} \cs{A} & = & \surb{ \surp{\idx{A}{\up{a}\dn{;b}} B^{b}}_{,d}
                                             C^d + \idx{A}{\up{m}\dn{;b}} B^b \Cnx{a}{md} C^d }
                                             \bv{a} \eqp
\eea
The third term yields
\be
 \nabla_{\surb{\cs{B},\cs{C}}} \cs{A} = \idx{A}{\up{a}\dn{;b}} \surb{\cs{B},\cs{C}}^b \bv{a} \eqp
\ee
Thus the action of the curvature operator is expressed as follows
\bea
 \mR\surp{\cs{B},\cs{C}}\cs{A}  & = &  \left\{   \surp{\idx{A}{\up{a}\dn{;b}}C^b}_{,d} B^d
                                               + \idx{A}{\up{m}\dn{;b}} C^b \Cnx{a}{md} B^d
                                               - \surp{\idx{A}{\up{a}\dn{;b}} B^b}_{,d} C^d
                                       \right. \nonumber \\
                                &    & \left.
                                         - \idx{A}{\up{m}\dn{;b}} B^b \Cnx{a}{md} C^d
                                         - \idx{A}{\up{a}\dn{;b}} \surb{\cs{B},\cs{C}}^b
                                        \right\}
                                         \bv{a} \eqp
\eea
Using the standard definition of the covariant derivative, expanding the partial derivative,
and using various index gymnastics the final result is
\be
 \mR\surp{\cs{B},\cs{C}}\cs{A}   =   \surp{   \Cnx{a}{bd,c} - \Cnx{a}{bc,d}
                                            + \Cnx{a}{sc}\Cnx{s}{bd} - \Cnx{a}{sd}\Cnx{s}{bc} }
                                     A^b B^c C^d \eqp
\ee
It is clear that in fact the Riemann tensor is a tensor; it is a linear operator on \cs{A},
\cs{B}, and \cs{C}.  The components of the Riemann tensor is then obtained from
\bea\label{eq:riemann}
  \idx{R}{\up{a}\dn{bcd}} & = & \ipb{\bd{a}}{\mR\surp{\bv{c},\bv{d}} \bv{b}} \nonumber \\
                          & = &   \Cnx{a}{bd,c} - \Cnx{a}{bc,d}
                                + \Cnx{a}{sc}\Cnx{s}{bd} - \Cnx{a}{sd}\Cnx{s}{bc} \eqp
\eea
\section{Non-Coordinate Basis}
As a final exercise, consider the components of Riemann in a non-coordinate basis.
Such a basis is characterized by a non-vanishing of the Lie bracket of the basis vectors
\be
\surb{\bv{a},\bv{b}} = \idx{C}{\dn{ab}\up{c}} \bv{c} \eqp
\ee
but with the standard relationship
\be
  d \bv{a} = \Cnx{c}{ab} \bd{b} \bv{c}
\ee
preserved.
Plugging these relationships into \refq{eq:riemann} gives
\bea
  \idx{R}{\up{a}\dn{bcd}} & = & \ipb{\bd{a}}{\mR\surp{\bv{c},\bv{d}} \bv{b}} \nonumber \\
                          & = & \ipb{\bd{a}}
                                {   \nabla_c \surp{ \ipb{d\bv{b}}{\bv{d}}}
                                  - \nabla_d \surp{ \ipb{d\bv{b}}{\bv{c}}} }
                                -\ipb{\bd{a}}{\ipb{d\bv{b}}{\idx{C}{\dn{cd}\up{m}}\bv{m}}} \eqp
\eea
Expanding and simplifying leads to
\be
  \idx{R}{\up{a}\dn{bcd}} =   \Cnx{a}{bd,c} - \Cnx{a}{bc,d}
                            + \Cnx{a}{sc}\Cnx{s}{bd} - \Cnx{a}{sd}\Cnx{s}{bc}
                            - \Cnx{a}{bp} \idx{C}{\dn{cd}\up{p}}
\ee
