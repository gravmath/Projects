%     From the second of Eqs. (\ref{parametric-ode}), it is clear that (apart from
% the case of linear equations with $\bf DF$ constant) parametric
% amplification can lead to growth of the parasitic modes ${\bf w}$.
    The second of Eqs.~(\ref{parametric-ode}), ignoring the cubic and
higher terms, is a linear equation (in ${\bf w}$) which from the time
dependence in ${\bf DF({\bf z}(t),t)}$ easily gives rise to parametric
amplification \cite{LL} leading to growth of the parasitic modes
${\bf w}$.
