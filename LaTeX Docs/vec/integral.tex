An integral is \emph{singular} or \emph{improper} if one or both limits are 
infinte or the integrand becomes unbounded at one or more points in the 
interval.  The plan of attack is to: 1) decide on integrability, 2) test
for convergence, and 3) calculate the integral (if integrable and convergent).
Case 1: Integral limits approach $\pm \infty$.
