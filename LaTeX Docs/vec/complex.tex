The point of this article is to establish the residue primitive result by explicitly
evaluating the contour integral
\[
   I = \oint_{\mathcal C} \left( z - z_0 \right)^n dz,
\]
where ${\mathcal C}$ is a circular contour around $z_0$ in a counterclock-wise (ccw)
direction.  Assume on ${\mathcal C}$ that $z - z_0 = R e^{i \theta}$ where $\theta$ 
goes from $0$ to $2 \pi$. With this parametrization $dz = R i e^{i \theta} d \theta$ and
\[
  I = i R^{n+1} \int_0^{2 \pi} e^{i \theta \left( n + 1 \right)} d \theta .
\]
There are two cases to consider: $n \neq -1$ and $n = -1$. 
In the first case
\begin{eqnarray*}
  I_{n \neq -1}  & = & i R^{n+1} \int_0^{2 \pi} e^{i \theta \left(n+1\right)} d \theta \\
                & = & \frac{R^{n+1}}{n+1} \left. e^{i \theta \left(n+1\right)} \right|^{2 \pi}_0 \\
                & = & 0
\end{eqnarray*}
and in the second
\[
  I_{n = -1}   = i \int_0^{2 \pi} d \theta = 2 \pi i
\]
To determine the value of the integral if the contour were traversed in the clockwise direction,
the limits of the integral can be reversed so that it went from $2 \pi$ to $0$ but ir is more
instructive to consider the closed contour ${\mathcal C} \rightarrow {\mathcal C}_{in} 
\rightarrow {\mathcal C}_{out} \rightarrow {\mathcal C}_{2}$.

From Cauchy's theorem $\left(z - z_0 \right)^n$ is analytic in the region bound by this combined
contour and the integrals over ${\mathcal C}_{in}$ and ${\mathcal C}_{out}$ cancel leaving
$I_{\mathcal C} = -I_{ {\mathcal C}_2 }$.

It sometimes happens that there is a pole on the real axis of an integral that
requires some additional effort in the calculus of residues. The approach is to
`side-step' the singularity by either going around it above or below
in the complex plane.  The figure below shows the situation with the 
pole at $z_0$ and where the contour along the real axis goes around it
by going above  along $\mathcal C$.

Let $z-z_0 = \rho e^{i\theta}$ on $\mathcal C$ with
$\theta \in [\pi,0]$ and $dz = \rho i e^{i \theta} d \theta$.  The integral 
\[
   I = \int_{\mathcal C} \frac{1}{z-z_0} dz
\]
becomes
\[
  I = \int_{\pi}^{0} i d\theta = -i \pi .
\]
If the lower contour is instead chosen, dropping below the pole into the lower half
of the complex plane, then the range of $\theta$ is now from $\pi$ to $2\pi$ meaning
that the value of the integral changes to $i \pi$.  This process is known as taking
the Principle Value of the integral.
