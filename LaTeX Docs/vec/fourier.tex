The Fourier transform (FT) of the unit step can be obtained by considering
the Schwartz function approximation
\begin{equation}
  U_{\alpha}(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} e^{-\alpha t} & t \geq 0 \\ 0 & t < 0 \end{array} \right.  
\end{equation}
in the limit as $\alpha \rightarrow \infty$.
The FT of $U_{\alpha}$ is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
{\mathcal F} U_{\alpha} & = & \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} U_{\alpha}(t) e^{-2 \pi i s t} dt \\ \nonumber
                        & = & \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\alpha t} e^{-2 \pi i s t} dt \\ \nonumber
                        & = & \left. \frac{-1}{\alpha + 2 \pi i s} e^{-(\alpha + 2 \pi i s) t}  \right|_{0}^{\infty} \\ \nonumber
                        & = & \frac{1}{\alpha + 2 \pi i s}.
\end{eqnarray}
The next step is to take the limit, but to make the limit meaningful, ${\mathcal F}U_{\alpha}$ must
be separated into real and imaginary parts
\begin{equation}
  {\mathcal F} U_{\alpha} = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha^2 + 4 \pi^2 s^2} - \frac{2 \pi s}{\alpha^2 + 4 \pi^3 s^2} i.
\end{equation}
The limit of the imaginary part is straightforward and yields $\frac{1}{2 \pi i s}$ but the real
part requires more care.  First calculate the integral of the real part $s \in [-\infty,\infty]$
\begin{equation}
I =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\alpha}{\alpha^2 + 4 \pi^2 s^2} ds .
\end{equation}
The value of $I$ is obtained by making the subsitution $s = \frac{\alpha}{2 \pi} \tan(\theta)$ to yield
\[
  I = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{ \sec^2{\theta} }{1 + \tan^2(\theta)} d \theta = \frac{1}{2} .
\]
Now note that the real part is zero as $s = \pm \infty$ and $1/\alpha$ at $s=0$, which means that the real part
is strongly-peaked at $s=0$.  The only function that integrates to a constant over $[-\infty,\infty]$, is 
strongly-peaked at the origin, where it tends to infinity, and is zero everywhere else is a function
proportional to the $\delta$ function.  Thus
\begin{equation}
 \lim_{\alpha \rightarrow 0} {\mathcal F} U_{\alpha} = {\mathcal F}U = \frac{1}{2} \delta(s) + \frac{1}{2 \pi i s} .
\end{equation}
\end{textblock*}
