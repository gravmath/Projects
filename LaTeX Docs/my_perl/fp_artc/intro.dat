%The Possible Impact of Finite Size Effects on LISA's Search for Gravitational Waves
The Laser Interferomotric Space Antenna (LISA) mission is a NASA
project meant to search for gravitational waves using inferometry 
between a formation of spacecraft in heliocentric orbit.  Like LIGO, its
terrestial counterpart, LISA's aim is to detect small changes in 
the proper distances between proof masses and to correlate these changes
against those predicted by Einstein's equations (or more appropriately their
$3+1$ equivalents).  An entire industry, devoted to 
developing greater levels of detail from the theory, has sprang up to satisfy the need
for signal templates used in the matched pattern filtering in LIGO and the same
levels of effort are anticipated for LISA. 
Template production is as much art as science at this point in time with several
different approaches being explored by different groups.  One on end of the spectrum 
of approaches is the Despite these differences

particulars of how the templates are bThe majority of
