Finally we arrive at the field equations for the ADM system.  The equations are
obtain by first recasting the Hilbert-Einstein action in terms of the shift, the
lapse, the 3-metric, and the extrinsic curvature.  Once done, a conjugate
momentum to the 3-metric is defined and the action is put into full Hamiltonian
form.
