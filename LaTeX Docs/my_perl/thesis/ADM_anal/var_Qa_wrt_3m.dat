To make the regular variational work more palatable, it is good 
to treat each piece in #ref(xxxx) separately.  This section considers
the variation of the term $ #Qa $ as the 3-metric is varied.
#be(Av3g2_1)
  #var #lp #cint #Qa #rp |_{ #var #3g(i,j) } = #cint #vby(#Qa,#3g(i,j)) 
                                             #var #3g(i,j)

Begin by expanding the integrand on the right-hand-side using the
standard definitions of $ #R0 $ to get
