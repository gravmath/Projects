In this section, the physical attributes of the constant-$t$ spacelike
hypersurfaces $\Sigma_t$ is presented.  First the foliation developed in the
preceding section will be interpreted.  The extrinsic curvature is then
defined and will be shown to be the rate-of-change of the 3-metric along
the vector field,$n^a$, normal to the set \{ $\Sigma_t$ \} of spacelike hypersurfaces.
Finally, the 3-dimensional Riemann tensor will be presented in terms of a
covariant derivative defined within the hypersurface.
