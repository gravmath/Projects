In this section, I present a Hamiltonian variational principle
for geodesic motion.  Since our ultimate aim is use 
this action as a model for the motion of a point-particle, we
will hereafter refer to any action describing geodesic motion
as the `point-particle' action and we will denote it 
as $ I_{pp} $.

The proposed variational principle is 
given by
#be(Pa1_1)
  I_{pp} = #lint m #lp #zdot(#m) #uvel(#m) - #L #Ham #rp #ec
#ee
where $ #zpos(#m) #lp #l #rp  $ gives the coordinates of the particle 
parametrized by the path parameter $ #l $ and 
$ #zdot(#m) #def \frac{ d {z^ #m } }{ d #l } $.  
The 4-velocity is given by $ #uvel(#m) $ and the Hamiltonian $ #mc(H) $ 
takes the form
#be(Pa1_2)
  #Ham = #1_2(1) #lp #4ig(#m,#n) #uvel(#m) #uvel(#n) + 1 #rp
#ee
The functions to be varied in #ref(Pa1_1) are $ #L $, $ #zpos(#m) $, 
and $ #uvel(#m) $.

As can be seen in #ref(Pa1_1), $ I_{pp} $ is invariant under changes 
to the path parameter $ #l $ with $ #L $, which acts as a Lagrange multiplier
that enforces 4-velocity normalization, adjusting under each 
re-parametrization.
